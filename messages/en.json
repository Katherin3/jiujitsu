The program combines Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu GI and NO-GI, self-defense in extreme conditions (Krav Maga), judo, sports psychology, and strict discipline.\n\nLearning these disciplines together is significantly more effective and result-oriented than studying them separately — both in sports competitions and in real-life, non-sport situations where quick thinking, adaptability, and control are essential.",
